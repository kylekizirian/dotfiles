## pdbrc

My pdb aliases, tweaked only slightly from
[Ned Batchelder's .pdbrc](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200704/my_pdbrc.html).
I described my changes
[here](https://kylekizirian.github.io/ned-batchelders-updated-pdbrc.html).

## gitconfig and gitignore

My git settings. My config aliases were mostly adopted from
[Git Workflows Appendix A](http://documentup.com/skwp/git-workflows-book#appendix-a---the-gitconfig)

## my_configs.vim

I utilize 
[Amir Salihefendic's vim configuration](https://github.com/amix/vimrc)
with a few of my own aliases added. This file goes into ~/.vim_runtime
after following the install instructions in the linked repo.

## inputrc

Adds vim key bindings to GNU readline, so that Python REPL
supports VIM keybindings.
